Analyze Bushwick Rezoning Proposal by mapping proposed new zones. Attaching new data to existing tax lot database (PLUTO). 
Specifically, I realize that I can draw commercial overlays using a buffer selection using the street centerline data for these selected properties. 
Python will help me with creating these selections and geometries. Automation will enable me to more quickly look at the entire neighborhood instead of pouring through repetative data entry.
In my previous class, I created a map displaying the existing zoning, so once this new map is completed, they can be overlaid with one another for analytical purposes.
