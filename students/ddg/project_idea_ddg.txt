# Data inputs

street_address
    geocode to lat/lng
MapPLUTO data (local or online)
    
# Output

shapefiles: geocoded addresses (points)
            selected MapPLUTO parcels

csv:        selected MapPLUTO parcels
                - only export certain columns from the data--is this possible? this would be super-helpful

# Steps

street addresses (csv)
    geocode to lat/lng
      # move into arcgis #
    create shapefile (points)
import MapPLUTO data (either locally or from online)
    select by location (overlap with points)
    export MapPLUTO as shapefile and csv 
        - if multiple points fall on the same parcel, can the output duplicate itself as many times as necessary? (i.e., if 4 points fall on the same BBL, can that BBL show up in the output 4 times?)

    * decide which columns to export?
    * can multiple layers be accessed? 
        (i.e., MapPLUTO, DOF tax, DOB)
        - is a join required or needed here?
