# My README file

After downloading the PLUTO tax lots shapefile, I also downloaded the street centerline shapefile in order to make buffer selections. 
I separated out by selection each major centerline to conduct more finely-grained/accurate estimations.

def project_upzoning(line_fc, buffer_distance, mappluto)
	buffer the line

	select mappluto by buffer (or poly if poly is input )

	make feature layer from selection

	feature class to feature class

	for feature layer add field

	calculate far field, based on expected increase
