The goal of my final project will be to automate the process of mapping & exporting bridge traffic volumes for a work report. 
The bridge traffic volume can be compiled with lat and long coordinates for where the In and Out traffic volumes will be positioned on the map.
There will also be lat and long coordinates for the corners of the extent of each map. Steps below.

Inputs
    In Traffic Volume (for each bridge)
    Out Traffic Volume (for each bridge)
    In Lat (for each bridge)
    Out Lat (for each bridge)
    In Long (for each bridge)
    Out Long (for each bridge)
    Extent Left Upper Corner Lat
    Extent Left Upper Corner Long
    Extent Left Lower Corner Lat
    Extent Left Lower Corner Long
    Extent Right Lower Corner Lat
    Extent Right Lower Corner Long
    Extent Right Upper Corner Lat
    Extent Right Upper Corner Long



Output
    create and export 3 maps of In & Out bridge traffic volumes with automation for future maps with possible inset

Steps
    Prepare excel file with volumes and coordinates
    determine extents needed for maps
    write code
    loop process
